Dissonant CMS
=============

The dissonant CMS is a *fully dynamic* and *extremely lightweight* CMS
which leverages the full power of PHPCR.

Extremely lightweight
---------------------

The DCMS application only consists of the bare minimum required to fire
transform a HTTP Request into a Response. There is no admin interface.

Fully dynamic
-------------

Instead it is intended that the user use something like `phpcr-shell` to
create and administer the system. A conventional administrative interface
can be created from the ground up *within* the CMS (or maybe simply
*imported*).
